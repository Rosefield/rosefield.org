            I am a long-term crypto nerd and security fanatic. 
I graduated from <a href="https://northeastern.edu">Northeastern University</a> with a BS in Mathematics, and am continuing as a PhD student in Computer Science researching cryptography with abhi shelat.
In particular, I am researching specialized efficient MPC protocols so that privacy-preserving computation can be deployed more widely.
Additionally I have interests in fully homomorphic encryption and searchable encryption.

            Over the summer of 2019 I worked in Group 53 at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">MIT Lincoln Lab</a> as a research intern.
During this internship I helped develop the internal MPC framework, implementing new primitives and an asyncronous execution model for certain computations.
Additionally, I developed an entry for Track IV of the <a href="http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2019/competition-tasks.html">IDASH Privacy & Security competition</a>.
With this project I evaluated models for MPC-friendliness, efficiency, and accuracy, and then implemented code to train the neural network in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner under MPC.

            Prior to my PhD I worked at <a href="https://ngpvan.com">NGP VAN</a> as a software engineer focused on application security and design.
            Aside from security contributions I helped create many of the client reporting tools available as part of the application, such as a high performance customizable grid report builder, a WYSIWIG PDF report generator, and an online form creator.

                One of my older projects is a <b>big integer library</b>, specifically designed for high performance calculation over finite fields. This implements methods for (constant-time) modular exponentiation, random number generation, and primality checking. Performance compares favorably to OpenSSL's specialized implementation of RSA encryption (within a factor of 4) for 4k keys, despite using variable-width integers. <b>N.B.</b> While originally designed to test public key cryptographic operations this library should not be used for any security-critical applications. Further progress could be made to support other field types (e.g. finite field over an elliptic curve) or better composability (e.g. a generic `field` type to allow rationals/polynomials/etc).

                As another fun project is a <b>song fingerprinting</b> application. This can be used to generate a database of song "fingerprints" and check for membership of samples. It is robust to small changes in pitch, frequency, and noise (such as identifying a song from a cell phone recording).

                <b>DHT file store</b> is an attempt to implement a BitTorrent-like file storage protocol using distributed hash tables with asyncio Python. Given an initial node a new client can bootstrap themselves into the network where they can store and retrieve files identified by the hashes of their contents. Each file chunk is automatically distributed to a configurable (default k=7) number of other nodes for resiliency. Locally, a file that has been distributed to the network is just a list of all of the hashes for each 1MB chunk in the original file.  Possible improvements include a better UX for file storage/retrieval such as having a FUSE file system that automatically reads and stores to the network.
