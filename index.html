            I am a long-term crypto nerd and security fanatic. I recently graduated from <a href="https://northeastern.edu">Northeastern University</a> with a BS in Mathematics. Further, I intend on pursuing a PhD in Computer Science researching cryptography and its applications towards privacy. In particular I hope to improve the efficiency of fully homomorphic encryption so that it can be more widely deployed to solve problems with encrypted search or secure computation.

            <p>
            I am currently employed at <a href="https://ngpvan.com">NGP VAN</a> as an individual contributor focusing on application security and design. Aside from security contributions I also worked to create many of the client reporting tools available as part of the application.

                One of my older projects is a <b>big integer library</b>, specifically designed for high performance calculation over finite fields. This implements methods for (constant-time) modular exponentiation, random number generation, and primality checking. Performance compares favorably to OpenSSL's specialized implementation of RSA encryption (within a factor of 4) for 4k keys, despite using variable-width integers. <b>N.B.</b> While originally designed to test public key cryptographic operations this library should not be used for any security-critical applications. Further progress could be made to support other field types (e.g. finite field over an elliptic curve) or better composability (e.g. a generic `field` type to allow rationals/polynomials/etc).

                As another fun project is a <b>song fingerprinting</b> application. This can be used to generate a database of song "fingerprints" and check for membership of samples. It is robust to small changes in pitch, frequency, and noise (such as identifying a song from a cell phone recording).

            <p>
                <b>DHT file store</b> is an attempt to implement a BitTorrent-like file storage protocol using distributed hash tables with asyncio Python. Given an initial node a new client can bootstrap themselves into the network where they can store and retrieve files identified by the hashes of their contents. Each file chunk is automatically distributed to a configurable (default k=7) number of other nodes for resiliency. Locally, a file that has been distributed to the network is just a list of all of the hashes for each 1MB chunk in the original file.  Possible improvements include a better UX for file storage/retrieval such as having a FUSE file system that automatically reads and stores to the network.
